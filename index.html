            <h3>Education</h3> 
            <p>One of our values is to provide education for those who cannot afford it.  We provide school fees, books, and uniforms (when necessary) and identity documents paid for by The Dream Project. Many children might otherwise not have the opportunity to receive formal education.</p>

            <p>Failure is a great teacher, and I think when you make mistakes and you recover from them and you treat them as valuable learning experiences, then you've got something to share.</p>

                <p>Working in education means youâ€™re never truly working alone. From paraprofessionals and teaching assistants to other classroom teachers and school leaders, working as a teacher often means working effectively in a group. It's also important to keep an open mind and learn from other educators. </p>

                   <p>Effective teachers need to be able to work in a constantly evolving environment and adjust their teaching methods based on the age of their students, the resources available and changing curriculum, practices and requirements.</p>
